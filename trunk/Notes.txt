Development Progression Plan:
	DONE: Implement Player Controls
	Implement Dealer
		Will have to make adjustments to CardInHand to allow for Dealer's card placement.
		Dealer strategy should be easy because there's no "thinking" involved.
		Insurance will have to be implemented somewhere.
	Implement Realistic Gameplay (Tough!)
		Cards collected in which order
		When the deck is shuffled
		This will have to probably run in it's own thread or something.
			Allowing timings and Thread.Sleep() locks up the UI thread.
			This could be a pretty cool screensaver mode.
	Implement Betting
		Maybe add chip icons by the player graphical coolness.
		Icons to bed in increments instead of +/- (Click to add, right click to remove)
	Implement Automated Strategies
		Basic Strategy
		Custom Made Ones
		Popular Strategies
		Maybe the ability to make a strategy on the fly

If needing to attached a control event to a non-Command event look below. It doesnt appear possible to bind to more than one event at a time though.
